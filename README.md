# CS-350
The premise of the project was developing a wifi compatible thermostat.
I think I did a good job particularly on diagramming an outline for how the thermostat code would work. I had a hard time wrapping my head around how the pieces interacted at first and ended up putting a lot of time into making strong diagrams.
I think that I could improve my work with more thorough commenting. If I had to come back to this project in six months I think there would be some pieces of code that I did not immediately know the purpose of.
I will definitely continue to use Draw.io for state machine diagrams in the future since it made them so quick and easy.
I think that knowledge of task scheduling and interrupts will be useful in any and all future embedded work that I do.
The code for this project is pretty well organized into separate sections dealing with I2C, GPIO, UART, Timers, interrupt handlers, task scheduler, etc. This makes the entire project easy to navigate and maintain.
